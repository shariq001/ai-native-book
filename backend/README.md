## Purpose

The backend directory contains:

1. **Specifications** - Detailed feature specifications for all modules
2. **Development Tools** - Scripts and templates for specification-driven development
3. **Project Memories** - Historical context and decision records
4. **Configuration Files** - Tooling configurations for the project

## Key Features

This project implements a specification-driven development approach where:

1. **Specifications are written first** - All requirements and acceptance criteria are defined before implementation
2. **Automated planning** - Specifications automatically generate implementation plans
3. **Quality assurance** - Built-in validation and checklist systems ensure quality
4. **Traceability** - Complete history of decisions and changes

## Technologies Used

- Specification-driven development with custom tools
- Markdown-based specifications
- Automated task generation and tracking
- Quality validation tools

## Development Process

1. Define feature specifications with clear user stories and acceptance criteria
2. Generate implementation plans from specifications
3. Create automated tasks based on user stories
4. Implement features following checklist-based quality standards
5. Validate implementations against original specifications
